"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is 
marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes 
short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;

great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in 
the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at 
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those 
cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
