# Dotfiles
These are my dot files. I primarily use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org), but on occasion have been known to use [Arco](https://arcolinux.com/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org), or some other Arch based flavor. I also run Debian or Ubuntu on a few server type systems, so I also try to make sure my dotfiles work there as well, and very occasionally I'll use a MacBook, where these dotfiles work for the most part, but I don't bend over backwards to make sure they do. 

**The main things here are:**
1. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. 
2. My [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
3. My window manager configuration.
4. My [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) configuration.
5. My [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io/) configuration.
6. My configs for [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

## My Setup
Currently, my main system is Arch Linux running on a Ryzen 5 2600X (6-core) CPU & a GTX 1050Ti. I primarily use the [Awesome Window Manager](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) as... well, the window manager; it's run, confoundedly, in tandem with [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) to replace the standard wibar (I know it's dumb, but I don't want to hear it). I'm also a big fan of [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm). I use [iBhagwan's Picom Fork](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom-ibhagwan-git) for transparency and whatnot, [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my main terminal ([kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) or [st](https://st.suckless.org/) as a backup), and [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as my text editor. You can view all of my dotfiles here, or you can check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWh6YtclgTAzReTASc4uSKw) for a more in-depth look at many of the configurations featured.
