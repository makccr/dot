# Dotfiles
These are my dot files. I've primarily been a [MacOS](https://apple.com/macos/) user for most of the time I've been collecting dotfiles, but I've recently switched to Linux. I primarily use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org), [Arco](https://arcolinux.com/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org), or some other Arch based distro; so that's where I take my que. I also run Debian or Ubuntu on any server type systems I have (just for stability), so I also make sure my dotfiles work there as well.

**The main things here are:**
1. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. 
2. My [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
3. My [Awesome Window Manager](https://awesomewm.org/) configuration.
4. My [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) configuration.
5. My [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io/) configuration.
6. My configs for [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) & [Vifm](https://www.vifm.org/).
7. Snippets for [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com/) & [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). 

I mainly use these apps: Vim & the Shell for standard writing; normally in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) format. I'm not a programmer, so I haven't customized these apps to make those kinds of tasks easier, the way that many users do.
