# Dotfiles
These are my dot files. I primarily use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org), or on occasion [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org). But I do also run Ubuntu LTS andior Fedora Workstation from time to time, so I also try to make sure my dotfiles work there as well. The same thing is also true of [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), which I also have been known to daily drive for brief periods, but in no way do I put a ton of effort into ensuring my configs work there as well.

**The main things here are:**
1. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. 
2. My [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
3. My window manager configuration, usually [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) or [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) these days, though I also have used Awesome WM in the past.
4. My [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) configuration.
5. My [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io/) configuration.
